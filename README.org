* Dave's Dotfiles
  Because all of the cool kids version control their dotfiles.

  Perhaps you are interested in my Emacs configuration. That has its
  own repository. [[https://github.com/davexunit/.emacs.d][Check it out.]]

** What's in the Box?
  You will find my configuration files for:
   - Bash
   - Git
   - GNU Guile
   - GNU Screen
   - StumpWM
   - X

** Installing
   The dotfiles are installed by creating symlinks from the
   =dotfiles/= directory to the current user's home directory.

   To install, just run =make=.
