* Dave's Dotfiles

  Because all of the cool kids version control their dotfiles.

  You will find my configuration files for:
   - Bash
   - GNU Screen
   - StumpWM
   - X

  Perhaps you are interested in my Emacs configuration. That has its
  own repository. [[https://github.com/davexunit/.emacs.d][Check it out.]]
